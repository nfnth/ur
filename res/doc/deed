### On Deed to Domain

Enter **Dralun**, a world inspired by adventure, and the dApp powered by *geocache* and an *explorer's trade*, all powered by **NFT**.

Use a *deed domain* **NFT** as both,


- *deed*, a token to store in an electronic wallet, to share/trade with others
- *domain*, a key to access a domain and build profile


Post content to build your domain. Posted content can consist of text, images, location, and datetimes, to be associated with the domain.
<br/><br/>
Domain content can only be added/edited/deleted by the owner of the NFT **deed domain**. All posted content is public and can be viewed by anyone.

Upon transfer of the **NFT** to another wallet, all  *domain access* and *profile content* are also transfered.
<br/><br/>
